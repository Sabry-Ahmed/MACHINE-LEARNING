# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis System for Large Companies

This project aims to develop a comprehensive sentiment analysis system tailored for large companies, enabling them to extract and understand customer emotions from both text-based (emails) and audio-based (phone calls) interactions. By analyzing these customer interactions, companies can gain valuable insights to enhance their customer experience and satisfaction levels.

## Dataset
The project utilizes two types of data:
- **Text**: Dataset comprising email conversations or transcripts of phone calls between customers and customer service representatives.
- **Audio**: Recordings of these conversations.

## Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes:
- Distribution of emotions in both text and audio data.
- Analysis of conversation lengths.
- Exploration of emotions expressed in different scenarios.
- Handling missing values in both audio and text data.
